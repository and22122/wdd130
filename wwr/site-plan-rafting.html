    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to make white-water rafting available to any interested parties. This should include providing information, training, and equipment related to white-water rafting.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      This site is meant for the general public- any groups who are willing and able to participate. This should be as accessible as possible. Therefore this website should be available regardless of circumstance. It is not intended for a specific demographic; it is intended to address questions, comments and concerns about white-water rafting; it needs to be able to provide resources for dealing with circumstances that make rafting less available; and it needs to be available across as many platforms as possible.</p>
