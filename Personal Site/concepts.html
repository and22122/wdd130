        <h2><b>Concepts of STEAM: Diving in</b></h2>
        <h3><b>What are some STEAM concepts?</b></h3>
        <p>
            Once again, STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. This seems simple at first, but each one is more complex than it might seem at first. Each of these has several concepts associated with it, such as a process or a way of thinking.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Concepts of Science</b></h3>
        <p>
            Science uses the scientific method- observation and questioning, hypothesis, prediction, testing/experimentation, and analysis. It also mandates replicability, sharing and recording of data, peer review, careful measurement, and more.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Concepts of Technology</b></h3>
        <p>
            Technology involves the application of knowledge in a way that is used to solve problems. When people think of technology, they often think of new developments, such as phones, computers, and more- things that involve circuitry, processing, and oftentimes mechanics. However, technology refers to more than that. For instance, things such as screws, nails, axes, clocks, and sleds are all examples of technology! They all rely on simple machines to function- screws and sleds use inclined planes, screws, nails, and axes all use wedges, and clocks use wheels.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Concepts of Engineering</b></h3>
        <p>
            Engineering also has its own process and way of thinking; it involves finding a problem, researching it, coming up with requirements, brainstorming, evaluating, and finding a solution, developing a prototype or the solution, testing it, communicating the results, and, often, repeating those steps to improve on the solution or fix problems with the solution.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Concepts of Art</b></h3>
        <p>
            Art is in some ways simpler, but it still often includes its own way of thinking, and there are still many things that factor into it. Art is versatile because it involves presentation and design. It involves thinking about form, and not just function. It's surprisingly complex- to an outsider, it might look like art is all about "does it look good?" However, it includes color theory, principles of design (such as contrast, hierarchy, and more), and psychology!
        </p>
        <h3><b>Concepts of Mathematics</b></h3>
        <p>
            Mathematics also has certain processes and ways of thinking that are involved with it. It has processes for problem solving, and it's prevalent in many a task. It's so inherent to life that even babies are usually able to do math to a degree- it's been shown that babies are able to compare (to a degree) different amounts of items!
