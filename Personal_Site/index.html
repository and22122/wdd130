                    STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. It includes some of the fastest-growing careers in the world, such as computer science, graphic design, and more.

                <h3><b>Why is STEAM important?</b></h3>
                <p>
                    STEAM is becoming more and more prominent in today’s society. It’s incredibly versatile, and its influence is far reaching. For instance, the process of creating and selling a product is swamped with STEAM. Someone must come up with an idea for a product, and they must design (there’s that art!) the product. Then they need to translate that into an actual product, which normally involves lots of engineering- as well as use of technology for the manufacturing process. They need to repeatedly send the product through the engineering process as part of the testing process (which also often involves experimentation and analysis, both of which are part of science). Then they send it to the marketing department (marketing involves lots of economics, which includes both science and mathematics), after which it must be manufactured (this usually involves both science and technology) before it can be distributed.
